        <h3>Astigmatic Dial</h3>
        <p>An Astigmatic Dial, also known as a Jackson Cross Cylinder (JCC) dial, is a tool used by optometrists to diagnose and measure astigmatism. It features a series of lines radiating from a central point, allowing patients to identify which lines appear clearest, helping to determine the degree and axis of astigmatism.</p>

        <h3>Ishihara Color Vision</h3>
        <p>The Ishihara Color Vision Test is a widely used diagnostic tool for detecting color vision deficiencies, particularly red-green color blindness. It consists of a series of plates with colored dots forming numbers or shapes that can be identified by individuals with normal color vision but are difficult or impossible for those with color vision deficiencies.</p>

        <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
        <p>A Color Contrast Eye Test is a visual assessment designed to evaluate an individual's ability to distinguish between different colors and shades. It is crucial for diagnosing color vision deficiencies, ensuring proper color perception, and can be particularly important for activities where accurate color differentiation is essential, such as in design, art, and certain technical fields.</p>

        <h3>Visual Field</h3>
        <p>A visual field eye test measures the entire scope of vision, including peripheral (side) vision, to detect any gaps or blind spots. It's used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as glaucoma, retinal diseases, and neurological disorders that can affect the visual pathways.</p>

        <h3>Amsler Grid</h3>
        <p>The Amsler Grid Test is a simple, quick tool used to assess the central visual field and detect issues such as macular degeneration. By staring at a central dot on a grid, patients can identify distortions, blurriness, or missing areas in their vision, which may indicate underlying eye conditions.</p>
